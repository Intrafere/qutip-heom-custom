# qutip-heom-custom

This repository contains a fully modular and extensible implementation of the **Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM)** formalism for simulating quantum systems with non-Markovian memory effects. Built to integrate seamlessly with QuTiP, this package supports:

- Arbitrary hierarchy depth and bath spectral functions
- Customizable system-bath interaction operators
- Full control over thermodynamic and relativistic embedding (via memory tensor couplings like $g\\tau_B$)
- Analytical and numerical exploration of entropy production, coherence revivals, and observer-based dynamics

This project attempts direct simulation of the experimental physics laid out in the Intrafere Research Group's **g-tau framework**, including multi-phase memory interfaces, relativistic feedback effects, and thermodynamic anomaly tracking at phase criticalities.

> Developed by Patrick Henry White as part of the Intrafere Research Group open-systems and quantum memory dynamics research efforts.
